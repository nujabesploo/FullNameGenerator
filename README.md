## 🌟 What's This Magic?

Imagine your name as a puzzle - each piece has its place, but arranging them properly is an art. The Name Weaver takes your name components and, like a skilled conductor orchestrating a symphony, arranges them into a perfect composition.

## ✨ Features That Sparkle

🎯 **Smart Assembly**: Like a LEGO master builder, it knows exactly how to put the pieces together  
🧹 **Space Cleaner**: Trims away excess spaces like a digital barber  
🎨 **Flexible Canvas**: Handles optional parts like middle names and suffixes with grace  
🎭 **Proper Etiquette**: Adds commas for suffixes, because manners matter!

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Plant the seed
javac FullNameApplication.java

# Watch it bloom
java com.pluralsight.FullNameApplication
```

## 🎮 Let's Play!

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

Like a well-oiled machine, this program:
1. Opens its arms to welcome your input (Scanner)
2. Tidies up each name piece (trim)
3. Stores them safely in its memory vault (array)
4. Weaves them together with artistic precision
5. Presents your name like a masterpiece! 

## 🎓 Why It's Cool

Think of it as a name barista - it takes your raw ingredients (name parts) and crafts them into a perfectly balanced brew. No more awkward formatting or missing commas!

## 🌈 Perfect For

- Forms that need properly formatted names
- Business cards that demand perfection
- Anyone who wants their name to look as awesome as they are!
